Hi NAME,

I Hope you are well. I've recently been applying to jobs in IT Industry and discovered a position that would be a great fit (DevOps Engineer) at your company(COMPANY NAME).

I noticed that you work at (COMPANY NAME). and was hoping that you could refer me.  If you feel comfortable doing so.  Your referral would mean a lot to me.

I've included a few lines on me below. As well as my resume.  To provide context. please let me know if there's anything else I can provide that might be helpful.

Thank you so much in advance for your help.
